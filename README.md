# Simulation of transmission loss according to ISO 12354-1

Software developed in MatLab that allows to simulate the transmission loss of different materials, taking as reference the Sharp, Cremer, Davy and ISO 12354-1 models. To use the software, a GUI was developed. Also the user can add new materials to the existing database.
